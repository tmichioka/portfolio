### Project
**Predictors of Self-Disclosure in Romantic Relationships: Love, Trust, or Relationship Satisfaction?**
- Self-disclosure, or sharing personal information about yourself with others, can bring benefits both to your relationship with your partner and to your own well-being
- While we know that having a strong and healthy relationship encourages people to open up, not much research has looked at how three key parts of a relationship—romantic love, trust, and overall satisfaction—work together to influence self-disclosure
- This study explores whether these aspects predict how much people share about themselves and also looks at whether gender and race affect this pattern 
- We used a publicly available dataset called *Self-Disclosure and Health*, collected by Ma (2020), in which 393 participants in relationships completed an online survey.
